## Projects
### Gaussian Process Approximation for Big Data Analysis | **R**, **C**
[Summary](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BjLjjhXRd49oTYrOswL_LhWnvsaotD1f/view?usp=sharing) &emsp; | &emsp; [Full Document](https://drive.google.com/file/d/19RFRp5JYcwoebJ0KiAXG5ITHQa5CC3Zz/view?usp=sharing)  
The onset of big data has introduced new challenges in the geostatistics community. Kriging is a prominent prediction tool used in spatial statistics, but it has cubic time complexity. As datasets become larger and larger, gaussian process regression can potentially become computationally inefficient. For my honours project, I explored different ways to approximate a Gaussian process to speed up its computation. The code is available at request.  

### Training a basic Neural Network from first principles | **R**
[Readme File](https://github.com/mishanphiri/portfolio/blob/main/Doc.md)  
Utilising **R** to classify hawks into three species by constructing a basic (8)-network from first principles that uses body weight and wing length as classifiers. The goal is to use measurements alone to automate classifying hawks into species. This is a demonstration of my understanding of neural networks.
### Database management system for a Pizza Delivery App
[Readme file](https://github.com/mishanphiri/portfolio/blob/main/Database_management.md)  
Creating a database management system for a startup idea for an app: Pizza Delivery with Entertainment. The basic functionality of the app is as follows:
Customers can order pizzas from restaurants to be delivered to a speciﬁc address, and customers can choose a special “entertainment order” option. When an order is an entertainment order, the delivery person stays with the customer after delivering the pizza and entertains the customer.

### Queries of a movie industry database | **SQL**
[Readme file](querries.md)  
The provided database contained information on the movie industry, with all actors and the necessary information to capture in a movie context. Queries used to extract information from the database
